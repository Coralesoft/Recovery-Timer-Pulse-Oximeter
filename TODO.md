## üöÄ QUICK WINS (Do These First!)

1. **Fix any inconsistencies** - Quick scan for pin number mismatches
2. **Add missing tester names** - Lillybelle, Dad, Mum in TESTING.md
3. **Create video script** - Even if not filming, shows planning
4. **Add sample data** - Quick CSV export from serial monitor
5. **Final spell check** - Professional presentation matters

---

## üìù NOTES

- DO NOT modify RecoveryTimer.ino (it's working perfectly)
- Keep Year 12 student voice (enthusiastic but not overly technical)
- Focus on showing journey, not just final product
- Emphasize problem-solving and learning process
- Include both successes and challenges
