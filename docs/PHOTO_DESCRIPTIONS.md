- Proper I2C connections (SDA/SCL) to GPIO 21/22
- Power connections (3.3V, GND) correctly implemented
- Clean breadboard layout following good practices

## Assessment Criteria Evidence

### Photos demonstrate:
✅ **Systematic Development** - Sequential component testing and integration
✅ **Iterative Improvement** - LCD to OLED display upgrade clearly shown  
✅ **Technical Implementation** - Proper wiring and assembly techniques
✅ **Testing Methodology** - Serial output verification and component validation
✅ **User Experience Consideration** - Attention to display readability and sensor positioning
✅ **Documentation Quality** - Clear photos that verify written descriptions

## Missing Documentation (Recommendations)
For complete Excellence-level submission, these additional photos would strengthen evidence:
- Complete assembled system showing all components integrated
- Final project in enclosure or finished housing
- Close-up of final wiring showing ESP32 pin connections clearly
- User testing photos showing device being used by different people
- Before/after photos highlighting specific improvements made

## Technical Quality Assessment
- **max30102-wired.jpg**: Clear, well-lit photo showing wiring details
- **button-test-serial.png**: High quality screenshot with readable text
- **lcd-test images**: Good focus on display, clear text visible
- **oled-mock-up.jpg**: Excellent clarity showing final display implementation

## Circuit Verification
Comparing photos with circuit diagram ESP32-Diagram-Final.svg:
- ✅ MAX30102 sensor connections match diagram specifications
- ✅ SSD1306 OLED display properly connected via I2C bus
- ✅ Push Button correctly wired to GPIO25 (D25) as shown in diagram
- ✅ Buzzer connection to GPIO15 (D15) matches diagram
- ✅ Power distribution properly implemented (3.3V/GND)
- ✅ I2C bus connections correctly shared between sensor and display (D21/D22)
- ✅ Component placement allows for practical user interaction
