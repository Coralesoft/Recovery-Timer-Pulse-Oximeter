# Video Documentation - Recovery Timer Project

## Overview
This document describes each video in the `/docs/videos/` folder and explains what they demonstrate for assessment purposes.

## Individual Component Test Videos

### buzzer-test.mov
**What it demonstrates:**
- Buzzer component working correctly with different beep patterns
- Shows the different audio feedback types used in final project
- Demonstrates early testing phase before integration

**Assessment relevance:**
- Evidence of systematic component testing methodology
- Shows iterative development approach (test components individually first)
- Audio feedback is important usability feature in final design

### lcd-test.mov  
**What it demonstrates:**
- Early display testing using LCD instead of OLED
- Shows iteration in display choice (LCD → OLED)
- Basic text display functionality working

**Assessment relevance:**
- Evidence of design iteration and component comparison
- Shows I tested multiple display options before choosing OLED
- Demonstrates systematic approach to hardware selection

### oled-mock-up.mov
**What it demonstrates:**
- OLED display showing mock user interface design
- Testing display layout and text sizing
- User interface design iteration process

**Assessment relevance:**
- Shows user interface development and testing
- Evidence of design refinement (mockup → final interface)
- Demonstrates consideration of user experience

## Video Analysis for Assessment Submission

### Recommended Main Submission Video
**Primary Video: oled-mock-up.mov**
- Best demonstrates user interface design and functionality
- Shows clear display output that assessors can evaluate
- Represents significant development milestone (display working)
- Good video quality for assessment viewing

### Videos Showing Iterative Improvements
1. **lcd-test.mov** - Shows initial display approach
2. **oled-mock-up.mov** - Shows improved display choice and UI design
3. **buzzer-test.mov** - Shows audio feedback implementation

### Missing Videos (Recommendations for Future)
For a complete submission, these additional videos would be valuable:
- Complete system demonstration showing full recovery timer cycle
- Sensor placement and finger detection demonstration  
- User testing session with external person
- Final project in enclosure/finished state
- Side-by-side comparison of initial vs final versions

## Technical Quality Notes
- **buzzer-test.mov**: Good audio quality, clearly demonstrates functionality
- **lcd-test.mov**: Clear view of display, good lighting
- **oled-mock-up.mov**: High quality, shows display clearly, good demonstration

## Assessment Criteria Coverage
These videos provide evidence of:
✅ **Iterative Development** - Shows component testing and design evolution
✅ **Systematic Testing** - Individual component validation approach
✅ **User Interface Design** - Display layout and feedback systems
✅ **Technical Implementation** - Working components and integration

## Recommendations for Final Submission
1. **Use oled-mock-up.mov as primary demonstration video**
2. **Include all three videos to show development progression**  
3. **Create a final system demonstration video if possible**
4. **Ensure video files are in compatible format for assessment platform**
