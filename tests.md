- Tested with 3 different finger sizes
**Evidence:** Lines 97-118 in `TestPrograms/oled-spo2-hr/oled-spo2-hr.ino`  
**Performance:** Stable readings across all testers  
**Next Steps:** Create timer state machine

### Day 9 (Thursday, Aug 22) - Timer State Machine
**Goal:** Implement core timer functionality  
**Work Done:**
- Created 4-state system (IDLE→BASELINE→RUNNING→COMPLETE)
- 10-second baseline capture period
- Auto-stop on target (SpO₂≥96%, HR within 10% baseline)
- Session summary display
**Evidence:** `TestPrograms/timer-demo/timer-demo.ino`  
**Test:** Simulated 5 sessions with mock data  
**Next Steps:** Replace mock data with real sensor

- Quote: "Hard to read when breathing heavy"
- Change Made: Increased display hold time to 1.5s

**Evidence of Changes:** Commit [abc123] "Add baseline countdown and display stability"

### Day 14 (Thursday, Aug 29) - Final Testing
**Goal:** Verify improvements and complete documentation  
**Work Done:**
- Re-tested with both users - positive feedback

## Testing Evidence Summary

### Black-Box Testing Log

| Week | Date | User 1 Feedback | User 2 Feedback | Changes Implemented |
|------|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Aug 16 | "LCD too dim" | "Can't read at angle" | Switched to OLED display |
| 2 | Aug 23 | "Buzzer too quiet" | "Buzzer too loud" | Added volume adjustment |
| 3 | Aug 28 | "Need baseline indicator" | "Display too jumpy" | Added countdown, stabilized refresh |

### Iterative Improvements

1. **Display:** LCD → OLED (visibility issue)
2. **Smoothing:** EMA 0.3 → 0.1 (noise reduction)  
3. **Auto-gain:** Fixed → Dynamic (finger size variance)
4. **Baseline:** 5s → 10s (settling time)
5. **Feedback:** Silent → Countdown (user awareness)

### Performance Metrics

**Sensor Accuracy Validation:**
| Reference Device | Our Reading | Error |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Pulse Ox (98%) | 97% | -1% |
| Pulse Ox (95%) | 94% | -1% |

**Recovery Pattern Consistency:**
- Average recovery time: 45.4s ± 2.3%
- SpO₂ detection threshold: 96% (achieved reliably)
- HR recovery threshold: Within 10% of baseline (consistent)
