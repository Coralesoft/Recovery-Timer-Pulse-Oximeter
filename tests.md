# Testing My Recovery Timer

## Component Tests
I made separate test programs for each part to make sure everything worked before putting it all together.

### Basic Sensor Test âœ…
**File:** `experiments/basic_sensor_test/basic_sensor_test.ino`  
**What it does:** Just reads raw RED and IR values from the MAX30102  
**Result:** Works! IR values go from ~1000 (no finger) to ~15000+ (with finger)  
**Problems:** None - this was easy

### Button Test âœ…  
**File:** `experiments/button_test/button_test.ino`  
**What it does:** Prints messages when button pressed/released  
**Result:** Works perfectly with INPUT_PULLUP  
**Problems:** None

### OLED Display Test âœ…
**File:** `experiments/oled_test/oled_test.ino`  
**What it does:** Shows text and a counter on the display  
**Result:** Works great once I found the right I2C address  
**Problems:** Spent ages trying 0x27 address, turned out to be 0x3C

### Buzzer Test âœ…
**File:** `experiments/buzzer_test/buzzer_test.ino`  
**What it does:** Makes different beep patterns  
**Result:** Works fine, can make short/long/multiple beeps  
**Problems:** None

### Heart Rate Algorithm Test âœ…
**File:** `experiments/heart_rate_test/heart_rate_test.ino`  
**What it does:** Uses the proper algorithm to calculate heart rate and SpO2  
**Result:** Works but takes practice to get stable readings  
**Problems:** Really sensitive to finger movement, takes 30+ seconds to stabilize

### Everything Together Test âœ…
**File:** `experiments/everything_together/everything_together.ino`  
**What it does:** All components working at same time  
**Result:** All parts work together without conflicts  
**Problems:** None

## Main Program Testing

### Version 1 - Basic state machine
- Got idle â†’ baseline â†’ timing â†’ results working
- Finger detection threshold needed tweaking (settled on 6500)
- Exercise detection was hit-or-miss

### Version 2 - Improved detection  
- Lowered heart rate increase needed from 15% to 8%
- Added 3 second settling time when finger returns
- Much more reliable exercise detection

### Version 3 - Stable readings
- Added simple smoothing (80% old + 20% new values)
- Limited display updates to 500ms to stop flickering  
- Readings much more stable

### Version 4 - Final polish
- Added different beep patterns for different events
- Session storage working (keeps last 20 sessions)
- Long press data export working

## Real-world Testing

### Test Session 1 - Me
- Baseline: HR 72, SpO2 98%
- Exercise: 20 jumping jacks
- Recovery time: 45 seconds
- Notes: Worked perfectly!

### Test Session 2 - Dad  
- Baseline: HR 65, SpO2 97%
- Exercise: Run upstairs twice
- Recovery time: 38 seconds  
- Notes: His fitness is better than mine ðŸ˜…

### Test Session 3 - Mum
- Baseline: HR 70, SpO2 98%
- Exercise: 15 jumping jacks
- Recovery time: 52 seconds
- Notes: Had trouble keeping finger still at first

## Problems Found and Fixed

1. **Readings jumping around** 
   - Problem: Raw sensor values too noisy
   - Fix: Added smoothing with weighted average

2. **Finger detection unreliable**
   - Problem: Threshold too low, getting false positives
   - Fix: Increased from 5000 to 6500

3. **Exercise detection not working**  
   - Problem: Heart rate increase threshold too high
   - Fix: Reduced from 15% to 8% increase

4. **Display flickering**
   - Problem: Updating every loop cycle
   - Fix: Only update every 500ms

5. **Button sometimes registers multiple presses**
   - Problem: No debouncing
   - Fix: Added 50ms debounce delay

## Final Test Results âœ…

**All requirements met:**
- âœ… Timer-based project
- âœ… Captures and stores data  
- âœ… Repeatable user interface
- âœ… Uses advanced programming techniques
- âœ… Multiple subsystems working together

**Performance:**
- Baseline capture: Works consistently in 10 seconds
- Exercise detection: 95% reliable with proper finger placement
- Recovery timing: Accurate to Â±2 seconds
- Data storage: Keeps 20 sessions, export works perfectly

**User feedback:**
- Easy to understand display
- Audio feedback helpful
- Instructions clear
- Some practice needed for stable readings

*Total testing time: About 2 weeks on and off*  
*Most time spent on: Getting stable heart rate readings*  
*Biggest breakthrough: Adding the smoothing algorithm*
